At my current work, we use client briefs to complete specific taks requested.
Each task takes time and an SQL server gathers all data at the end of the day to calculate costs.

This little application enables the user to add and select breifs from a list and have a time counter calculate the time worked.

In future updates, this tool will also be in charge to update the SQL table which holds the data.
